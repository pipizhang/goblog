**_A blog base on Padrino._**

Preface
-------
Padrino is a ruby framework built upon the excellent {Sinatra Web Library}[http://www.sinatrarb.com].
Sinatra is a DSL for creating simple web applications in Ruby quickly and with minimal effort.
This framework tries to make it as fun and easy as possible to code more advanced web applications by
building upon the Sinatra philosophies and foundations.
